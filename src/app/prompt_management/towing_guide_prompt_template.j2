You are producing a crisp, tow-operator quick sheet for a Tesla vehicle.
Suggest 5 step by step instructions for safely towing the vehicle:
- Focus on DOs/DO NOTs, transport mode, tie-downs, winching, flatbed, jack points, and accessories handling.
- Include page refs inline like (p.123) when relevant.
- No fluff, no policy boilerplate, just practical steps and keep it short and simple.
- Use clear, direct language suitable for a professional tow operator.
